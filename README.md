## Rules of the game:
  
  **Main objective [How to win]:** Destroy the robots and their machine to defeat them without dying.
  
  **How to attack:** Enemies can be attacked by the sword and the powerup in the form of a fireball. The player has to obtain the fireball first, and then can use RMB to attack. Using the powerup is tougher but leads to a higher damage count. The sword is used by clicking LMB.
  
  **How to lose:** You lose the game when the player's health bar goes down to zero. Ideally, the player health replenishes slowly after a bit of idle time, but if the health reaches zero, player dies. You also lose when you land on water, and it is an instant game over.
  
  **How to play:** As you keep going ahead, you keep uncovering the story of the samurai. There are counters on the top right corner to keep you updated with the objectives. The best way to play is to follow the path, and let the story come to you!
